1. What is the big O for this?
    1a. O(1) - (selecting object from an array)
    1b. O(n) - (you are looping through an array)

2. Even or Odd
    O(1) - only one action is occuring one time, regardless of input

3. Are you here?
    O(n^2) - they are nested loops with linear iterations

4. Doubler
    O(n) - the function grows linearly based on the length of the array

5. Naive search
    O(n) - linear search through array

6. Creating Pairs
    O(n^2) - nested linear operation

7. Compute the Sequence
    O(n) - loops through the results array, pushes next value to the end of the array - fibonacci sequence

8. An Efficient Search 
    O(n) - the search gets smaller after each iteration

9. Random Element
    O(1) - it does one operation regardless of input

10. What am I?
    This function checks to see if a number is prime or not
